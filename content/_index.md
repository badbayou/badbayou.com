## Who We Are

We are Bad Bayou - a Louisiana-based community of cybersecurity professionals, ethical hackers, and technology enthusiasts. Like a good gumbo, we bring together diverse ingredients to create something greater than the sum of our parts.

## What We Do

Our community focuses on building cybersecurity knowledge while embracing the Louisiana spirit of hospitality and good times:

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Research & Education

We explore the latest vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and defense mechanisms while sharing knowledge through workshops and presentations.

### üéì Hands-On Learning

From Capture The Flag competitions to live demonstrations, we believe in learning by doing - with a side of jambalaya.

### ü§ù Community Building

We foster connections between security professionals, students, and enthusiasts in a welcoming, inclusive environment.

### üéâ Good Times

Because cybersecurity doesn't have to be all serious all the time - we know how to laissez les hack temps rouler!
